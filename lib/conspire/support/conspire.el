;;; Commentary:

;; Let's use git for real-time collaborative editing!

;;; Code:

(defvar conspire-interval 0.33
  "Number of seconds to wait before syncing with conspire.")

(defun conspire-mode ()
  "Toggle conspire-mode for real-time collaborative editing."
  (interactive)
  (if (and (boundp conspire-mode) conspire-mode)
      (progn
        (set (make-local-variable 'conspire-mode) t)
        (set (make-local-variable 'conspire-timer)
             (run-with-idle-timer conspire-interval
                                  :repeat 'conspire-sync-buffer)))
    (setq conspire-mode nil)
    (cancel-timer conspire-timer)))

(defun conspire-sync-buffer ()
  "Synchronize buffer with Conspire repository."
  (when (buffer-modified-p)
    (save-buffer)
    (shell-command "conspire commit")
